**Welcome to CS11 Intro C++ Lab 7!**

The write-up for the lab is available at this URL:

>   http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab7/index.html

This repository starts out containing this `README.md` file, and test code
for the functionality that your Matrix implementation must support this week.
Read the lab write-up to see what you need to implement.

Additionally, this lab is a continuation of the previous lab, so you will want
to copy your source files (`matrix.h`, `matrix.cpp` if you have one, and your
`Makefile`) from the previous lab into this repository, and `git add` them as
described in the `lab1/README.md` notes.

As with the previous labs, when you `git push` your work to the server,
automated tests will be run on your code to exercise its basic functionality.
Let us know if you get stuck on anything so that we can help you figure it
out.  Have fun!
