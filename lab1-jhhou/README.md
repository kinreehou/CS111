**Welcome to CS11 Intro C++ Lab 1!**

The write-up for the lab is available at this URL:

>   http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab1/index.html

You will notice that the repository for this lab contains no files.  You will
get to create them!  Implement your lab in this directory, following the file,
class and function names carefully (including capitalization).

When you create a new file, or when you make edits to an existing file, you
need to add it to your repository's "staging area" using this command:

    git add filename.cpp

When you are satisfied with everything in the staging area, you can commit the
changes to your repository with this command:

    git commit

You can do both of these steps in one command, like this:

    git commit -a

Just be aware that "`git commit -a`" will not add newly created files!  It
will only incorporate edits to files that it already knows about.

You can always tell what files are in your repository's staging area, and
what files that Git knows about (or doesn't know about) by typing:

    git status

Finally, make sure that you push your local commits to the repository on the
Caltech Gitlab server, both as you work, and when you are finished with the
assignment.  The command is easy:

    git push

Have fun!
