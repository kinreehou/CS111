**Welcome to CS11 Intro C++ Lab 3!**

The write-up for the lab is available at this URL:

>   http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab3/index.html

This repository starts out containing only test code for this week's lab.
Read the lab write-up to see how to build and run it.

Additionally, this lab is a continuation of the previous lab, so you will want
to copy your source files (`units.cpp`, `units.h` and `convert.cpp`) from the
previous lab into this repository, and `git add` them as described in the
`lab1/README.md` notes.

As with the previous lab, when you `git push` your work to the server,
automated tests will be run on your code to exercise its basic functionality.
Let us know if you get stuck on anything so that we can help you figure it
out.  Have fun!
