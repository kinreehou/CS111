**Welcome to CS11 Intro C++ Lab 6!**

The write-up for the lab is available at this URL:

>   http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab6/index.html

This repository starts out containing this `README.md` file, and test code
for your Matrix implementation.  Read the lab write-up to see what you need
to implement.

As with the previous labs, when you `git push` your work to the server,
automated tests will be run on your code to exercise its basic functionality.
Let us know if you get stuck on anything so that we can help you figure it
out.  Have fun!
